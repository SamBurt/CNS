- Add capability for 2 parent accounts to be associated with 1 (or more) child(ren)
- Email confirmations (to parents confirming registrations/edits and to admin summarizing recent registrations)
- Connect to Quickbooks and/or Child Care Manager API to automate entire process

- Advice: familiarize yourself with the authorization process, the set up of views/stylesheets and how a user navigates between pages, variable names in the database migration and what they stand for with respect to the forms, and associations between parents/users/children before adding new functionality.
